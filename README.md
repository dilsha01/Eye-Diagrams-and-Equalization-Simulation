# Eye Diagrams and Equalization Simulation

**Objective:**  
Developed and analyzed eye diagrams for baseband 2-PAM signaling using MATLAB.

## Key Contributions:

- **Pulse Shaping Filters:**  
  Implemented pulse shaping filters, including sinc and raised cosine filters, and evaluated system robustness against noise, sampling time, and synchronization errors.

- **Zero-Forcing Equalizer Design:**  
  Designed and tested a Zero-Forcing equalizer for a multipath channel, calculating BER under various noise conditions.

- **BER Performance Comparison:**  
  Compared BER performance of ZF equalized multipath channels with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.
